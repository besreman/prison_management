# prison_management

This project is an assignment done for Arbaminch university Software Engingeering department students(Transfered from Mekelle university 2012EC batches) for course advanced programming. It is super easy java project with UI and database connectivity. I used swing and AWT UI libraries for the UI part of the application. It is not complete project(I mean can be developed better if needed) but, it does what it should basically do.

# features of the project

# Technologies used
- Netbeans version 18 for UI design
- Postgresql for database
